    "## What does a dense layer accomplish?\n",
    "\n",
    "The general purpose of a dense layer is of course to handle arbitrary computation. As discussed in the [neural networks](../2-training-neural-networks/neural-networks.ipynb) section, and in the famous [bitter lesson], the most effective models are those that do not rely on hand-designed structures. In this way, a dense layer has almost zero implicit biases, save for regularatory structures such as smoothness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient of a dense layer is simple to compute. As the output is a linear combination of the input features (defined by parameters), the derivative of the output features are simply the input features themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which behaviors do we want to avoid?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main pitfall in a dense layer is **magnitude explosion**. If the parameters of a dense layer blow up in magnitude, then the corresponding features will also blow up, and gradients will become nonsense. It is important to keep track of the parameter magnitude for this reason. Thankfully, in general dense layers are stable to train and do not require much machinery to keep regularized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent magnitude explosion, we must properly initialize our dense layers to a reasonable starting point. Remember that the main parameter of a dense layer is an `(m,n)` matrix. A common way to measure the magnitude of a vector is via the **root mean squared (RMS) norm**, which is equivalent to the standard deviation for zero-mean vectors, and takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "RMS(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum x_n^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume our input features are well-behaved -- they are independently distributed and have an RMS of 1. If we naively initialize the weight matrix from a normal distribution, then the output feature norm would increase by a factor of `sqrt(m)`."

In contrast to the matrix parameters, biases don't suffer from any kind of symmetry issues (since they are rank-1 to begin with). While matrix initilization needs careful consideration, since any deviation will compound exponentially, biases only interact *additively* with features so they are not as sensitive."
