    "Deeper neural networks have the potential to become more powerful. They can perform more computation, and build off more abstract features. However, deeper networks also become harder to train. There are potential issues with **vanishing or exploding gradients**, in which certain badly-behaved layers can corrupt the learning signal for the entire network. A sneakier issue is that of a chicken-and-egg problem -- when later layers have not been properly trained, they will inhibit the earlier layers from learning relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Residual networks** add an explicit bias towards preserving prior information. In a residual network, we view the prime information flow as the **residual stream**. Each additional layer does not completely rewrite the residual stream, but instead appends new information to it. Thus, by default, information from prior layers is retained into later layers. We often group these operations into **residual blocks**. Residual networks are known to ease optimization, and provide shorter gradient flows between the intermediate features and signal from the loss function.\n",

It is possible to achieve the same residual effect by simply utilzing a parameter matrix that has a constant weight along the diagonal, which preserves the input features. However, even in this setting, the residual connection can be a powerful **inductive bias**. Residual layers will by default place a large emphasis on preserving the input, a behavior which otherwise is not present at random initialization."

    "In deep learning, we sometimes worry about network collapse. A common measurement is **rank collapse**, which occurs when a dense layer aligns its parameters such that the outputs become lower rank than the inputs. In a regular dense network, rank collapse cannot be undone -- once the information is lost, later layers cannot recover the information. However, in a residual network, even if a single layer exhibits rank collapse, the residual stream itself will retain its full-rank structure, as the previous features will remain unmodified.\n",

However, we want to progressively downsample these images within the network, as is typically done in convolutional architectures. The downside here is that we lose the high-frequency details present in the original image. The U-Net architecture uses residual connections between each *resolution*, allowing for information to flow back to the original image at various resolutions.\n",
