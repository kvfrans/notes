    "# Modern Optimizers\n",
    "\n",
    "The backbone of modern learning is gradient descent. We all know the pain of waiting for a model to train. So you can imagine a classic rite of passage is for researchers to think about ways to improve optimization. The current champion is Adam, however, a familiy of work has been building that claims to outperform Adam at the Pareto frontier of compute. In this post, we will explore the flavors of such optimizers, which we will refer to as **spectral-whitening** methods. Do such methods reliably outperform Adam? If so, in which ways do the various flavors have pros and cons?\n",

    "## Gradient Descent on Non-Euclidean Metrics\n",
    "When we calculate a gradient, we get a direction to adjust model parameters to reduce loss. But this gradient is only accurate in a local neighborhood. So we typicall take a *small* step in that direction, then re-calculate before moving again. This notion can be formalized by framing each step of gradient descent as solving the following distance-penalized problem:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g = \\nabla_\\theta L(\\theta,x)$. Traditionally, we assume a Euclidean distance over parameters, in which case the solution (as shown above) is simply the gradient scaled by a constant learning-rate factor $\\alpha$. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Euclidean distance is an assumption, and is often suboptimal. Certain parameters may be more sensitive to higher-order changes than others, and thus should be assigned a larger penalty. We can generally represent second-order distances using a metric matrix $M$, under which the distance of an update can be expressed as the matrix product:\n",

Intuitively, if any parameter is updated with too high a learning rate, the system can oscillate or at worse, diverge. A good distance metric should even out the sensitivities, such that each parameter is updating at close to its optimal rate.

    "\n",
    "## Relation to Newton's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical second-order optimization technique is **Newton's method**, which performs steepest descent using the Hessian as the distance metric. The Hessian is a matrix of second-order derivatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = E_{x\\sim D} \\left[ \\nabla_\\theta^2 L(\\theta,x) \\right]. \n",

    "\n",
    "Newton's method can also be interpreted as using a *quadratic* approximation of the loss function rather than a linear one. We can estimate the penalty for taking large steps entirely from the second-order effects of the step on the loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, Newton's method has practical problems when training deep neural networks -- first, calculating the Hessian itself is expensive, and second, the Hessian can potentially have negative eigenvalues and thus assign \"negative\" distance to certain directions. Both of these issues can be partially addressed by the **Gauss-Newton** approximation to the Hessian by considering only first-order terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla_\\theta^2 L(\\theta,x) = \\underbrace{\\nabla_\\theta f(\\theta,x) \\nabla_\\theta f(\\theta,x)^T}_{\\text{Gauss-Newton term}} + \\underbrace{(f_\\theta(\\theta,x) - y) \\nabla^2_\\theta f(\\theta,x)}_{\\text{Dropped second-order term}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the Hessian, the Gauss-Newton matrix is always positive semi-definite, and is easy to compute as the inner product of two gradients.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The whitening metric can now be understood as the *square-root* of the Gauss-Newton matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What motivates the square-root?** This is an excellent question, that I don't have a great answer for. One viewpoint is that the square-root is a consersative estimate of $G$, as $G^{1/2}$ is the halfway point between $I$ (Euclidean distance) and $G$. In [[Xi-Lin Li 2018]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10232), it is shown that the square-root of $G$ is the optimal solution for a preconditioner when accounting for *noisy* gradient estimates. [[Yang 2008]](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/cbir/papers/nn2008.pdf) argues that using the square-root of $G$ better approximates geodesic flows towards the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relation to Natural Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to motivate the whitening metric is through **natural gradient descent**, which aims to perform descent over the manifold of *probability distributions*. Natural gradient descent uses the **Fisher information matrix** as a distance metric, which is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = E_{x\\sim D, y \\sim p_\\theta(\\cdot|x)} \\left[ \\nabla_\\theta \\log p_\\theta(y|x) \\nabla_\\theta \\log p_\\theta(y|x)^T \\right].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fisher does not take the loss function into account. It is only affected by the shape of the probability distribution itself, as defined by the current neural network. This is why natural gradient descent is often motivated as being *parameterization-invariant*, and (at small enough steps) follows the same optimization trajectory regardless of the underlying parameter structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the particular expectation -- $y$ must be sampled from *the current distribution*, not from the dataset labels. This means the true Fisher cannot be calculated simply from gradients over samples from the dataset. When we instead use dataset labels, we end up with the **empirical Fisher**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = E_{x,y\\sim D} \\left[ \\nabla_\\theta \\log p_\\theta(y|x) \\nabla_\\theta \\log p_\\theta(y|x)^T \\right].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In most deep learning objectives, our loss is of the form $\\log p_\\theta(y|x)$ -- remember that mean-squared error is the log-probablity of a Gaussian distribution. So there's an immediate relation between the empirical Fisher, the Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation, and the whitening metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relation to Spectral Norm Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, examining the whitening metric under a particular parameterization reveals a third relation. First, let's consider a single dense layer with $\\theta \\in R^{m,n}$. A common trick to avoid inverting a giant $gg^T \\in R^{nm,nm}$ matrix is to factorize this matrix into its **Kronecker factors**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "gg^T \\quad \\approx \\quad (G^TG)^{1/2} \\otimes (GG^T)^{1/2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $g \\in R^{nm}$ is the flattened gradient and $G \\in R^{m,n}$ is the gradient in matrix form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kronecker factorization is used in many modern optimizers, and brings two keys benefits. First, we can invert each factor *independently*, and the resulting Kronecker product is equivalent as if we had inverted the product directly. Second, we do not need to actually form the Kronecker product -- instead, we can multiply the factors in sequence. These techniques form the following update, used in the KFAC [[Martens 2015]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05671) and Shampoo [[Gupta 2018]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09568) optimizer families:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we remove the expectations, a new relation appears [[Bernstein 2024]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20325). Let's write the matrix $G$ in terms of its singular-value decomposition, $G = U \\Sigma V^T$:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting update is the projection of the gradient update onto the closest *orthogonal* matrix. This is also the solution to steepest descent under the **spectral norm**, which measures distance as the maximum singular value of the matrix. Intuitively, the resulting $UV^T$ matrix has singular values of entirely 1 or -1, and is thus updating maximally in every orthogonal direction. Because of this relation, we will often refer to the Kronecker-factored form of the whitening metric as the **spectral-whitening metric**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we want to descend on the spectral norm?** This is another great question, which again I don't have a great answer for. The spectral norm represents the *maximum* possible change in a layer's output. In [[Yang 2023]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17813), it is argued that in neural networks, inputs tend to align with a layer's weights, so this bound is empirically tight. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Flavors of Optimizers\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's get into the various practical implementations of optimizers that descend on an approximate whitening metric. In all methods, the raw gradients are calculated via backpropgation over a batch of input/output pairs. All methods also treat each dense layer independently, which can be seen as using a blockwise approximation of the true whitening metric. We'll describe the optimizater code in terms of an incoming gradient, but in practice, a momentum is used instead. For nonstandard layers, such as layer norm vectors or embedding layers, Adam is used instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, we will focus on the core whitening behavior of the various optimizers. The original implementations of these methods have various details (e.g. learning rate grafting, Nesterov momentum, iterate averaging) that we will put aside. Aside from Adam, which uses an *elementwise* approximation of the whitening metric, the rest of the optimizers instead utilize the more informative *spectral-whitenining* metric."

    "So, do these modern optimizers actually outperform a well-tuned Adam, on settings we care about? Let's give them a whirl.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will largely build on the experimental settings we examined in the SPlus paper, with a few adjustments for more accurate comparison. We will consider the training of a standard GPT-2 style transformer on language modelling. The network will be trained for 10k gradient steps, with a batch size of 1024. All methods will use a warmup of 200 steps, and a cosine learning rate schedule decaying to zero. For all layernorm, input, and output parameters, we will use an Adam optimzer with a fixed tuned learning rate and weight decay. All methods use standard momentum. Training is done in `bfloat16`. We will measure performance on a fixed validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardest part of optimizer comparisons is ensuring that all methods are properly tuned. For our experiments here, we will tune the learning rate, weight decay, momentum (b1), and variance accumulation (b2) where applicable. Learning rate is tuned within a resolution of $\\sqrt[4]{10}$, weight decay between a resolution of $10$, and b1/b2 are chosen within `0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 0.995`. For all methods, we ensure that our resulting best hyperparameters are within the local minimum of these range, i.e. independent changes to each hyperparameter does not improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each optimizer, we will attempt to use the highest-performing variant. For Muon, we use the version with 15 unique coefficients. For Shampoo/SOAP/SPlus, we compute the matrix inverse every 10 steps. For PSGD, we update the preconditioner every step (instead of the default decaying probability).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that comparisons won't ever be perfect, since we can't feasibly try every combination of hyperparameters. In our specific setting, we found that varying the learning rate by a factor of $\\sqrt[4]{10}$ (the resolution we search over) result in a final validation of $\\pm 0.03$, so comparisons should be interpreted within this range of variation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As raw validation losses are hard to interpret, we also calculate Steps-to-Adam, an estimate of ratio of gradient steps used in each optimizer vs. Adam, to reach the same validation loss. These are calculated by running Adam for `(10000, 10500 ... 15000)` steps.\n",

    "To sanity check these findings, let's also see how these optimizers perform on the [Modded-NanoGPT Medium optimization leaderboard](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt/tree/master/records/061525_GPT2MediumOptimizationLeaderboard). The main point of comparison here is Muon, which has been tuned by the community, so we can assume that hyperparameters have been tuned decently. The leaderboard already contains entries for Adam and PSGD (although they may not be heavily tuned), so we will focus on benchmarking SOAP and SPlus. In the speedrun guidelnes, the goal is to find the lowest number of steps to reach a validation loss of `2.92`, with the architecture and data fixed. Since this involves sweeping over the training step length (as by default, a linear LR decay is used), we searched over a $\\pm 125$ resolution. Other hyperparameters are chosen in an ad-hoc manner.\n",

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the end, what did we find? I believe a main takeaway is that **spectral-whitening methods reliably outperform Adam, and they do so at roughly the same magnitude**. [[Zhao 2024]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07972v1) shows that elementwise-whitening optimizers (Adam, Signum, Lion, etc.) all perform similarly when hyperparameters are properly tuned. My current belief is that a similar relation holds for *spectral*-whitening methods. SOAP is the most effective optimizer per gradient-step, and this may be due to the role of the second moment in estimating signal-to-noise [[Orvieto 2025]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21829). In constrast, Muon and SPlus both approximate the instant sign of eigenvalues, which loses this property. Muon is particularly powerful due to its efficient computational properties. Likely, there is a method that can use the orthogonalization machinery of Muon while keeping the signal-to-noise estimation of Adam, and this optimizer will be great.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corollary to the above conclusion is that we haven't seen an optimization procedure that reliably goes *beyond* what the spectral-whitening optimizers can achieve. I would be very curious to see what such a method would look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to Jeremy Bernstein for a helpful discussion on this post.\n",
